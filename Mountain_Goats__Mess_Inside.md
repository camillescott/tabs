be done with strumming):

So here we go...

Intro = G

G
 We took a weekend, drove to Provo
C                               -Walk- G
 The snow was white and fluffy
G
 But a weekend in Utah won't fix what's wrong with us
C
 And the grey sky was vast and real cryptic above me

```
```
    D             C                        C  -Walk- G
 I wanted you, to love me like you used to do
```
```
G
 We took 2 weeks in the Bahamas
C
 Went out dancing every night
G
 Tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things
C                                D
 Most of the time I guess I felt alright
```
```
D      C        D     C                           -Walk- G
 But I wanted you, to love me like you used to do

G                   C
 But you cannot run, And you cannot hide
G                                       C                D       G
 From the wreck we've made of our house, And the mess inside
```
```
G
 We went down to New Orleans
C
 One weekend in the Spring
G
 Looked hard for what we'd lost
        C                           D
 It was painful to admit it, but we couldn't find a thing
```
```
D      C        D     C                           -Walk- G
 And I wanted you, to love me like you used to do

G
 Went to New York City in September
        C
 Took a train out of Manhattan, to the Grand Army stop
            G
 Found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago
        C                                   D
 When I felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop
```
```
D      C        D     C                           -Walk- G   D   G

G                                       C                D      G
 From the wreck we've made of our house, And the mess inside
