Verse 1:
All around me are familiar faces.

Going nowhere.  Going nowhere.
And their tears are filling up their glasses.
No expression.  No expression.
Hide my head; I want to drown my sorrow.
No tomorrow.  No tomorrow.

Chorus:
And I find it kinda funny.
I find it kinda sad.
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had.

Em G   A

Verse 2:

Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.

Chorus

Em G   A

Em G   A
