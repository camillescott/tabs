C                 Am
Love of mine, someday you will die,
F
But I will be close behind,
       C                  G
I'll follow you into the dark.


C	               Am
No blinding light, or tunnels to gates of white,
                        F
Just our hands clasped so tight,
            C               G
Waiting for the hint of a spark.


    Am                C              F           C         G
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
    Am               C                    G
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs,
Am                    C                   E     Am    G
if there's no-one beside you when your soul embarks,
A                Am                 F
I will follow you into the dark.



C                      Am
Catholic school, as vicious as roman rule,
               F                C          G
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black.
C                             Am                      F
I held my tongue, as she told me "Son, fear is the heart of love"
     C             G       
So i never went back.



    Am                C              F           C         G
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
    Am               C                    G
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs,
Am                    C                   E     Am    G
if there's no-one beside you when your soul embarks,
A                Am                 F
I will follow you into the dark.


C		      Am       
You and me have seen everything to see,
                  F
From Bangkok to Calgary,
           C                 G
And the soles of your shoes,

C                                 Am
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now,
                     F
But it's nothing to cry about,
                C              G                    Am         F
'Cause we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms.


    Am                C              F           C         G
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
    Am               C                    G
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs,
Am                    C                   E     Am    G
if there's no-one beside you when your soul embarks,
A                Am                 F
I will follow you into the dark.
