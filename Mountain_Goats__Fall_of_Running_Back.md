Sophomore year,   
    D              A          G               A           D    A   G   G 
you rushed for an average of eight and a third yards per carry.
G                   A
  All eyes were on you.
       D   A   G   G     
Junior year, 
   D           A              G           A
you blew your knee out at an out of town game.
G                       A
   Nowhere to go to but down, down, down.
D                                G           
Nothing but the ground left for you to fall to.

by July, 
       D          A          G         A
you'd made a whole bunch of brand new friends,
G                        A
people you used to look down on.
                   D   A           G         G
And you'd figured out    a way to make real money --
       D            A               G       A
givin' ends to your friends, and it felt stupendous.
G                      A
 chrome spokes on your Japanese bike,
      Bb                A
but selling acid was a bad idea,
      D                        G
and selling it to a cop was a worse one.
         D                      A                       D
And the new law said that seventeen year olds could do federal time.
G                               D                  G
  you were the first one, so I sing this song for you,
D                     G     
  William Stanaforth Donahue,
       D                        A
your grandfather rode the boat over from Ireland,
     D                G
but you made a bad decision or two.
      D A G A* D A G A (x2) D
yeah.
