Well Lanky Lenny is too tall to be lost and found
    A
Too big for the cages at the city pound
                E
So what will we do? 
                                B
What will we do for fun and for free?

See the roads are getting wider and wider most every day
   A                                          
I used to go out driving now I stay off the lanes
              E                                        B
So what's the use of looking out if there's nothing to see?

       C#m
Oh but somehow we're getting by.
   A
It seems a little bit easier to touch the sky
    E
But something's coming for you,
                        B
Something's coming for me.

         E          C#m          B
And it's no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
                        A
We're not like the others.
             E    B   A
Baby it's true
         E      C#m          B
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
                        A
We're not like the others.
                                  C#m
And we could not be, if we wanted to.

                   C#m
Oh Lazy Lauren was too small to go outdoors
    A
Too loud for the neighbors too slow for the chores
                 E
So what will we do? 
                                     B
What will we do for fun and for free?

                          C#m

I used to love the store but now I stay off the lanes
              E                                           B
So what's the use of getting up if there's nowhere to leave?

       C#m
Oh but somehow we're getting by.
   A
It seems a little bit easier to touch the sky
    E
But someone's coming for you,
                        B
Someone's coming for me.

         E          C#m          B
And it's no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
                        A
We're not like the others.
             E    B   A
Baby it's true
         E      C#m          B
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
                        A
