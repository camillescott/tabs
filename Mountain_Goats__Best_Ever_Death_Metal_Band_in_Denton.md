# Best Ever Death Metal Band out of Denton
## Mountain Goats


Tuning: Drop D (DADGBe)

Generally you want to play all 6 strings at once, letting the low D ring out.  The main riff is as follows:

```
   D             D             Dsus D    Asus D    Asus D    G             G             A             A
e--2(2)--2-2-2-2-2(2)--2-2-2-2-3(3)-2(2)-0(0)-2(2)-0(0)-2(2)-3(3)--3-3-3-3-3(3)--3-3-3-3-0(0)--0-0-0-0-0(0)--

John starts with a quiet D G A progression, to set the mood for some banter about the interesting background of the song.

Coming into the lyrics:

```
    D
the best ever death metal band out of denton
       G                          A
were a couple of guys, who'd been friends since grade school.
D
one was named cyrus, and the other was jeff.
         G                                A
and they practiced twice a week in jeff's bedroom.

-MAIN RIFF x2-

    D
the best ever death metal band out of denton
G                      A
    never settled on a name.
        D               
but the top three contenders, some of which have now been used,
             G                A                         D  (into main riff)
were satan's fingers, and the killers, and the hospital bombers!

-REPEAT MAIN RIFF-

         D               
jeff and cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
    G                               A
for stage lights and leer jets, and fortune and fame.
      D
so in script that made prominent use of a pentagram,
     G                             A
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names.
    G                      A
and this was how cyrus got sent to the school in Utah
           D                      G
where they told him he'd never be famous.
    G
and this was why jeff, 
       A                         D
in the letters he'd write to his friend,
                 G
helped develop a plan to get even.
         D
when you punish a person for dreaming his dream,
      G                         A
don't expect him to thank or forgive you.
    D
the best ever death metal band out of denton
        G                        A        (mute all strings)
will in time both outpace and outlive you!
     D
hail satan!
     G        A
hail satan, tonight!
     D
hail satan!
     G           A           D   
hail hail, hail, hail, hail, hail
```

From that last D, you can either go straight into the Main Riff, or use another normal D G A first (with a bit more intensity) and 
then go into the Main Riff.  John prefers the latter, but I like to go straight into the riff and then repeat it a second time.
