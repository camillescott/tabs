Verse 1
All the years combine
They melt into a dream
A broken angel sings
from a guitar
In the end there's just a song
Comes crying like the wind
Through all the broken dreams
and vanished years

chorus:
Stella Blue

Verse 2
When all the cards are down
There's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
In the end there's still that song Comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been

chorus:
Stella Blue

bridge:
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make 'em shine

Verse 3
It all rolls into one
And nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And when you hear that song
Come crying like the wind
Seems like all this life
Was just a dream

chorus:
Stella Blue
