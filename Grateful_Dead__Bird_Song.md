# Bird Song
## Grateful Dead

```
Intro/Riff:  D7--C-D7--C-D7
 
D7                                                    Riff
All I heard was something like a bird within her sing,
 
D7                                                  Riff
All I know she sang a little while and then flew on,
```

```
Bb   F      C                     G                    D7  Riff
Tell me all that you know and I'll show you snow and rain.
```
```
If you hear that same sweet song again will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passing by.
Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark, fly through the night.
```
```
Bm        A    G     D   A    G     D   A         G            D
Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore, la da da da.
Bm           A      G     D   A    G   D    A           G              D   D7
Sleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind, la da da da, da.
