Tuning: Standard, Capo 2nd

```
           C                   D              G        C
There are times that walk from you like some passing afternoon 
G                  D          C         D
Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon 
          C              D              G              C
And she chose a yard to burn, but the ground remembers her 
G                     D                   C         D
Wooden spoons, her children stir her bougainvillea blooms 


            C               D              G                C
There are things that drift away like our endless, numbered days 
G                 D                   C             D
Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made 
            C          D            G                C
And she's chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings 
G                   D                 C               D
Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves 


             C                D             G            C
There are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass 
G                       D                C              D
Springtime calls her children 'till she lets them go at last 
            C             D                 G               C
And she's chosen where to be, though she's lost her wedding ring 
G                      D                 C         D
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of bougainvillea seeds 


             C              D               G                  C
There are things we can't recall, blind as night that finds us all 
G                   D               C            D
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls 
         C             D              G                C
But my hands remember hers, rolling 'round the shaded ferns 
G                  D                C                D
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned 


            C               D         G         C
There are names across the sea, only now I do believe 
G                      D                   C               D
Sometimes, with the windows closed, she'll sit and think of me 
             C                  D                 G              C
But she'll mend his tattered clothes and they'll kiss as if they know 
G                 D                  C           D
A baby sleeps in all our bones, so scared to be alone
