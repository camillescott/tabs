# Proper Fence
## Shakey Graves

```
Capo 1

       G             D
Just a mile down the road
      G             C
And a street or two away
             G
There's that freckled missus that I
D               G
want most every day
           G           D
Out to the home of her father
          G                C
I'm gonna drag my sore old feet
         G
Tell him she's the woman who can
D               G
Wake me from my sleep

         Bm
She said kiss me
         Am
Lord, I listened, but
  Bm                C
I haven't gone back since
         G                  D                 G
Though I curse the mind for building a proper fence

           G            D
Now I will roll, I will suffer
          G                  C
Curse the soil and curse the stones
         G                      D                G
Keep my eyes a leaking for that girl does love my bones
G                   D
I've know her for a year
     G              C
Only seen her seven days
    G                D                G
One week too many to keep men like me away

         Bm
She said kiss me
         Am
Lord, I listened
         Bm                C
Though I haven't gone back since
         G                  D                 G
Though I curse the mind for building a proper fence

               G                  D
So three years after, I found her doorstep
          G                   C
Found her shoes and found her kin
             G                    D                   G
They told me old grim reaper done come and turned her in
        G             D
Pouring liquor on the stone
     G                 C
That marks my lost and gone
       G                  D               G
I will whimper, wail, and sing her funeral song
