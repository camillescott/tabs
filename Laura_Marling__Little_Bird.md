### Tab

```
Tuning: DGDGBD (low to high), Open G

I'll mostly just tab chord patterns. More than that isn't necessary for a lot of this.
It'd take ages to tab out all the plucking and stuff when it's easy enough to figure out 
from the chord patterns.

Intro

d|---------------0---------|
B|-7-------0-------0-------|
G|---9-6-7-----0-----0-----|
D|-----------0---------0---|
G|-0-------0-------------0-|
D|-------------------------|  x 3

(Second and third times are a slight variation on the open string plucking)

Verse
   Oh Rosie....
d|---------------0---------|
B|-7-------0-------0-------|
G|---9-6-7-----0-----0-----|
D|-----------0---------0---|
G|-0-------0-------------0-|
D|-------------------------| x 2

   I couldn't save you...
d|-----------------------------|
B|-7-------7-------7-------7---|
G|---9-6-7---9-6-7---9-6-7---9~|
D|-----------------------------|
G|-0-------0-------0-------0---|
D|-----------------------------|

Riff

d|-9-12--9-12-9-7-----------|
B|-8-12--8-12-8-7-7-5--4--3-|
G|----------------7-5--5--4-|
D|--------------------------|
G|-0-0---0-0--0-0-0-0--0--0-|
D|--------------------------|



Chorus
      Little bird...
d|-------------------------------|
B|-2~----------------0-2-3-5-7-7-|
G|-2~----------------0-2-4-6-7-7-|
D|-------------------------------|
G|-0~-----------------0-0-0-0----|
D|-------------------------------|  x 2

   With a feather in my wing....
d|--------------------------|
B|-3--------------5---------|
G|-3--------------5---------|
D|-3--------------5---------|
G|-3--------------5---------|
D|--------------------------| x 4

That's all the necessary parts. Here they are in chronological order:

### Lyrics

```
O Rosie
Where have you been
I couldn't save you
But I tried, Rosie
I tried

Why did you run
From everyone
Who only tried to
Love you, Rosie
Only tried

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

Why do you run
From everyone
Who only tries to
Love you, only tries...

Maybe I like pleasure pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine

So why not run
From everyone
Who only tries to
Love you, Rosie, only tries...

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

Maybe I like pleasure pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you

With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?
```
