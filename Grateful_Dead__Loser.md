# Loser
## Grateful Dead

```
If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abiliene.
Don't you push me baby because I'm all alone,
You know I'm only in it for the gold.

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars,
and I could pay you back with one good hand.
You can look around about the wide world over,
and you'll never find another honest man.

chorus:
Last fair deal in the country (sweet suzy),
Last fair deal in the town.
Put your gold money where your luck is baby,
Before you let my deal go down, go down.

Don't you push me baby becasue I'm all alone,
Cause I know a little something you won't ever know.
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee,
Gonna get up in the morning and go.

Everybodies prayin and drinkin that wine,
I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines.
Come to daddy on an inside straight,
Cause I got no chance of losing this time,
Cause I got no chance of losing this time,
Cause I got no chance of losing this time....

Notes:
1. The guitar riff goes e d c b a (single notes) with
an Am chord as backing.
2. The end of the last verse is like the end of the
chorus (C Em/B Am G D instead of C Em/B Am G Am).
3. Some ears may hear G/B instead of Em/B.
4. Per line of the verse there are 18 beats. As
18 is not evenly divisible by four we have a split
measure somewhere.
